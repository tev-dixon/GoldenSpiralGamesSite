# Golden Spiral Games Site

## ⚠️ **Note:** 
This site was originally part of a larger project and was quickly migrated from a dynamic Django-based implementation to a static site.

As a result, some parts of the code (particularly the CSS and repeated HTML) may be inconsistent or inelegant. This is largely due to the need to discard Django templates and style blocks and rapidly piece things together to preserve functionality.

While the current version is simplified and functional, it may benefit from further cleanup or restructuring if extended in the future.

## **For Future Developers:** 
If you have questions direct emails to teddixon@umich.edu.
